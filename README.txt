FPS Microgame Test Build 5

1. What post-processing changes you made to the microgame.  Be specific: provide a detailed description of the two changes.

I changed the bloom to be more intense, I added a film grain of a box to simulate a pixel overlay over the camera and make it all textured. I also added a vignette to make it less bright overall with a purple tonemap. 

Besides this I also managed to accomplish getting the shrink to work, added a new skybox, added a secret area for the shrunk player to visit, and changed the jump platform to be held by glass.
